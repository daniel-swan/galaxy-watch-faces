 - Your total ammo count is the days of the month. (30 days September, April, June, and November; all the rest have 31, except february who got 28 days for speeding on the sidewalk)


# Customizing the gun
There is a limit to the number of pictures you can have in a single customization. To get around the limit, I added a category for different gun types and an empty image.
All but the category of the gun you want to display has to be set to the empty image.
